# Bloggin-app-backend

<h2>It is backend repository of the Blogging Application</h2><br><br>
It has the following features:-<br>
1).It uses MongoDb as the database server.<br>
2).It is completely based on NodeJs and ExpressJs to make it fast, scalable & non-blocking in nature.<br>
3).It uses mongoose as a wrapper to model MongoDb so that we can use it in our Node Application directly instead of Mongo Shell.<br>
4).In it route is protected with the help of authrization middleware.<br>
5).In it I create basic REST APIs having CRUD functionalities.<br>
